  {
    question: "What age groups do you teach?",
    answer: "We welcome learners of all ages! Our youngest students are typically 6 years old for Rubik's cube training, while our calligraphy courses are popular with teens and adults. We customize our teaching approach to match each learner's developmental stage and learning style."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need any prior experience to start?",
    answer: "Not at all! Our courses are designed for complete beginners. We start with the fundamentals and gradually build up your skills. Whether you've never touched a Rubik's cube or held a calligraphy pen, we'll guide you through every step of your learning journey."
  },
  {
    question: "How are the online classes conducted?",
    answer: "Our live online classes use interactive platforms with high-quality video, screen sharing, and real-time feedback. Classes are small (max 8 students) to ensure personalized attention. All sessions are recorded so you can review them later."
  },
  {
    question: "What materials do I need to get started?",
    answer: "For Rubik's cube courses, you'll need quality speed cubes (we can recommend specific models). For calligraphy, you'll need brush pens, practice paper, and basic supplies. We provide a detailed materials list upon enrollment and can suggest where to purchase everything."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I get a refund if I'm not satisfied?",
    answer: "Yes! We offer a 30-day money-back guarantee. If you're not completely satisfied with your course experience within the first month, we'll provide a full refund. We're confident you'll love learning with us, but your satisfaction is our priority."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer certificates upon completion?",
    answer: "Absolutely! Upon successful completion of any course, you'll receive a digital certificate of achievement. Advanced students can also work toward instructor certification, which qualifies them to teach others under our guidance."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it take to see progress?",
    answer: "Most students see noticeable improvement within 2-3 weeks of consistent practice. For Rubik's cubes, many can solve a 3x3 within a month. Calligraphy students typically develop basic letterforms within 3-4 weeks. Remember, everyone learns at their own pace!"
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer one-on-one tutoring?",
    answer: "Yes! We offer private lessons for students who prefer individualized instruction or have specific goals. Private sessions can be scheduled flexibly and are perfect for competition preparation or addressing particular challenges."
